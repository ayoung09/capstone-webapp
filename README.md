## Games

To play, one person should be running the web app on a computer, and all players will need the mobile app on downloaded to their phones.

#### Drawkward

Based on the popular game Drawful, Drawkward is a multiplayer real-time drawing game that accommodates anywhere from 4 to 14 players.

In Drawkward, each user will receive a short phrase to sketch on their app. <br>

After all phrases are submitted to the server, the drawings will be displayed one by one on the web app, and each user (except the artist) will submit a phrase that they think best describes the picture. <br>

Next, the list of phrases (including the original phrase) will be shown to every player, and players will pick the phrase they think was the original phrase.

After each round, the picture with its original phrase will be displayed, along with a scoreboard.

There are 2-3 rounds, depending on the number of users.

At the end of the game, the top 3 scores will be displayed.


#### Pictionary

In Pictionary, users will divide into two teams, with one phone per team.

Teams will switch off drawing on the team's phone. When one member of a team is drawing, the rest of the team will look at the main screen and guess as many drawings as they can in the 1 minute allotted.
When the word is guessed the artist will press "Got it!" to receive points or can press "Skip!" to get a new word.

Rounds will continue until each player on each team has drawn at least once.
